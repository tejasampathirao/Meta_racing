# Employee Tracker - MQTT Client & SQLite Mirror Database
# ============================================================================
# PURPOSE:
#   This script acts as a backend server that:
#   1. Listens for employee data sent over MQTT from a mobile app (Flutter/Dart).
#   2. Stores that data into a local SQLite database — mirroring 6 tables:
#      users, attendance, leave_requests, employee_expenses, live_locations, travel_attendance
#   3. When an admin requests it, sends back ALL stored data over MQTT.
#
# HOW IT WORKS (High Level):
#   Mobile App  ---[MQTT message]--->  This Script  ---[saves to]--->  SQLite DB
#   Admin App   ---[fetch request]--->  This Script ---[reads DB & replies]---> Admin App
#
# PREREQUISITES:
#   pip install paho-mqtt   (MQTT client library)
#   Python's built-in sqlite3 and json modules (no install needed)
# ============================================================================

# --- IMPORTS ---

# sqlite3: Built-in Python library to create and interact with SQLite databases.
#           SQLite is a lightweight database stored as a single file on disk.
import sqlite3

# json: Built-in Python library to convert between Python dictionaries and JSON strings.
#       JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a standard text format for sending data.
import json

# paho.mqtt.client: Third-party library that lets Python connect to an MQTT broker.
#   MQTT = Message Queuing Telemetry Transport — a lightweight messaging protocol where:
#     - A "broker" (server) routes messages between clients
#     - Clients "publish" messages to a "topic" (like a channel name)
#     - Clients "subscribe" to topics to receive messages on those channels
#   Think of it like a group chat: you join a channel (subscribe) and
#   anyone can send a message (publish) to that channel.
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

# os: Built-in Python library for file path operations.
import os

# datetime: Built-in Python library to work with dates and times.
from datetime import datetime


# ============================================================================
# CONFIGURATION - Settings that control how the script connects and operates
# ============================================================================

# MQTT_BROKER: The IP address or hostname of the MQTT broker (message server).
#   "localhost" means the broker is running on the SAME machine as this script.
#   In production, change this to a remote server IP like "192.168.1.100".
MQTT_BROKER = "localhost"  # Change to your broker's IP if not local

# MQTT_PORT: The network port the MQTT broker listens on.
#   1883 is the standard default port for unencrypted MQTT connections.
#   (8883 is typically used for encrypted/TLS connections.)
MQTT_PORT = 1883

# DATA_TOPICS: A list of MQTT "topics" (channels) this script subscribes to.
#   Each entry is a tuple: ("topic/name", QoS_level)
#
#   Topic names use "/" as separators (like folder paths) to organize messages.
#   Each topic corresponds to one of the database tables used by the Flutter app:
#     - "employee/tracker"           → attendance table (check-in/check-out, work logs, reports)
#     - "employee/tracker/hr/leaves" → leave_requests table (leave applications)
#     - "employee/tracker/location"  → live_locations table (real-time GPS)
#     - "employee/tracker/expenses"  → employee_expenses table (all expense types)
#     - "employee/tracker/travel_attendance" → travel_attendance table (travel records)
#
#   QoS (Quality of Service) = delivery guarantee level:
#     0 = "At most once"  — fire and forget, message may be lost
#     1 = "At least once" — guaranteed delivery, but may arrive twice
#     2 = "Exactly once"  — arrives exactly once (slowest)
#   We use QoS=1 to ensure data isn't lost, even if a duplicate comes through.

    ("employee/tracker", 1),                    # attendance, work logs, work reports

# Step 3: Set up the "on_connect" callback.
#   This function runs automatically once the client successfully connects to the broker.
#   It also prints a confirmation message showing the connection was successful.
#
#   Parameters (paho-mqtt v2.0+ callback signature):
#     c  = client object
#     u  = userdata (None)
#     f  = flags (connection flags from broker)
#     rc = reason code (0 = success, non-zero = error)
#     p  = properties (MQTT v5 properties, can be ignored for basic usage)
#
#   c.subscribe(...) tells the broker: "Send me messages from these topics."
#   We subscribe to all 11 DATA_TOPICS + the FETCH_REQUEST_TOPIC (12 subscriptions total).
def on_connect(c, u, f, rc, p):

    # $SYS/broker/log/M = logs related to MQTT messages and client activity.

# Step 4: Register our on_message function as the callback for incoming messages.
# Whenever a message arrives on any subscribed topic, MQTT library calls on_message().
client.on_message = on_message

# Step 5: Connect to the MQTT broker.
#   MQTT_BROKER = server address ("localhost")
#   MQTT_PORT   = port number (1883)
#   60          = keepalive interval in seconds. The client sends a small "ping"
#                 every 60 seconds to tell the broker "I'm still alive."
#                 If the broker doesn't hear from us for 1.5x this time (90s),
#                 it assumes we disconnected.

# Step 6: Start the MQTT event loop. This is a BLOCKING call — it runs forever
# and never returns (unless an error occurs or the program is killed).
# Inside this loop, the library:
#   - Maintains the broker connection
#   - Sends keepalive pings
#   - Receives incoming messages and calls on_message() for each one
#   - Handles reconnection if the connection drops
